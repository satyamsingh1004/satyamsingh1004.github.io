Add/Update Items in Datasources:
1. SubmitForm(EditForm)
2. Patch

Modifies or creates one or more records in a data source. 
The values of specific fields are modified without affecting other properties.

Update a record:
Patch( DATA_SOURCE, ITEM_TO_MODIFY, PROPERTIES_TO_UPDATE )
Patch( Customers, First( Filter( Customers, Name = "Contoso" ) ), { Phone: "1-212-555-1234" } )

Create a record:
Use Patch with the Defaults function to create records. 
Patch( DATA_SOURCE, Defaults(DATA_SOURCE), PROPERTIES_TO_UPDATE )
Patch( Customers, Defaults( Customers ), { Name: "Contoso" } )

Even if you're not working with a data source, you can use Patch to merge two or more records.
Patch( RECORD1, RECORD2 )
Patch( { Name: "Contoso", Phone: "1-212-555-1234" }, { Name: "Contoso", Location: "Midtown" } )
